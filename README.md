# Increment_Threshold_Experiment_VisualField
An experiment measuring increment thresholds using square stimuli and Pokorny &amp; Smith's (1997) pulsed- and steady-pedestal paradigms under hypothetical parvocellular- and magnocellular-biased conditions. The adaptive QUEST (Watson &amp; Pelli, 1983) is used to more efficiently and accurately measure the thresholds.
